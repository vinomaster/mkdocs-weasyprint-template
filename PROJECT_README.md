# PROJECT_NAME
Manage the development and maintenance of the PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION. This paper focuses on how the Foundation is organized and what it will deliver.

This repo contains the content resources for the generation of a white paper deliverable.  It contains the tools necessary to generate two document renderings (printed, online).

## Contents

1. Online White Paper Access
    * [GitHub Pages](https://<ORG_NAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/)
    * [Doc Website ]() **FIX LINK**
2. Printable Docs ([PDF Version]())

## Dependencies
* [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* PDF Generation
    * [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/)
    * [MkDocs PDF Export Plugin](https://github.com/zhaoterryy/mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin)

## Documentation Development Process
The PROJECT_NAME leverages uses standard *pull-request* code collaboration processing. Contributors to this repo should create a ```fork``` and then use that ```fork``` as  the origin for their ```local machine``` based development.

### Local Development Process
This repo uses **GitHub Pages** to host the static HTML content that is generated by MkDocs. The ```gh-pages``` branch reflects the latest committed docs. See ```make pages```.

Use  ```make``` to manage the build process for this repo.

```
$ make
```

#### Prepare Development Environment (MacOS)

1. Clone repository

```
git clone REPO_LINK
git remote
git remote add upstream REPO_LINK
git remote
```

2. Setup Environment

```
$ make setup
```

#### Develop content
Iteratively develop documentation content using markdown files.

```
$ make dev
```

#### Test content
Iteratively review online content using [localhost](localhoat:8800).

```
$ make test
```

#### Generate HTML and PDF Docs
This repo uses ```mkdocs gh-deploy``` to push generated HTML content to the ```gh-pages``` branch on the ```origin``` repo on GitHub. This process also creates a single PDF document in the ```pdf``` folder but the file is not pushed.

```
$ make pages
```
>Note: You can ignore the DEBUG and WARNING messages during the PDF generation.

#### Commit Code
To complete the development process, follow normal **git commit** and **git push** processing. The ```.gitignore``` file will prevent the pushing of the static HTML content.

#### Resync with Upstream
Before each coding session, insure your ```fork``` and ```local-machine``` are in sync with changes made to the ```upstream``` repo.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master\
```

### Upstream Refresh Process
This repo uses a [GitHub Workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml) process coupled with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/mkdocs-github-deploy) to automatically refresh the GitHub Pages on the ```upstream``` repo.

## Help
